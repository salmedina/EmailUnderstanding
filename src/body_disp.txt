In preparation for going live with the new version of EnronOnline, please set 
your products to allow Price Limit Orders. You can do this by:

1) Highlighting the Product and selecting "Product Properties"
2) In the lower right hand corner, verify that the :
- Price Tick size is where you want it (The Price Tick controls the minimum 
price increments which a customer can specify)

- The Max Volume in the "Orders" section is set where you want it.

If you do not do this, customers will not be able to place Price Limit Orders 
on your Products

If you have any questions, please call the EnronOnline Help Desk (North 
America: 713 853 4357,  Europe: +44 20 7783 7783, Australia/Asia: +61 2 9229
