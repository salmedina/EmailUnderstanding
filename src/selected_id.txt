SUBJECT:     CAISO Notice - Valley-Rainbow Transmission Project
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< BODY >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
Market Participants:

At the May ISO Governing Board meeting the Board directed
Management to bring back to the Board a recommendation on the "parameters
and process" for proceeding with a competitive solicitation (Valley-Rainbow
RFP) to determine if there are cost-effective and reliable alternatives to
SDG&E's proposed Valley-Rainbow transmission project. The specific Board
motion can be found at:
WEBLINK
yRainbow500KVProject.htm
WEBLINK
eyRainbow500KVProject.htm>  and additional information on the project can be
found at WEBLINK
WEBLINK
These matters are scheduled to be addressed at the August 1
Board meeting. Attached is a memo that outlines ISO Management's preliminary
thoughts and recommendations on how to structure the process for conducting
and the parameters of the Valley-Rainbow RFP.  Please provide us your
thoughts and feedback on these matters no later COB Friday, July 21.  Please

recommendations outlined below are clearly a work-in-progress, it is
imperative that we receive your substantive feedback early so that we can
develop a fair and reasonable final recommendation. Thanks for your time and
consideration.

SUBJECT:     For Discussion: Implementing Definition of Trading Office
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< BODY >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
this is the memo I was referring to - 

i.e. very draft!
What are your thoughts?

I was going to write that the buying and selling of physical commodity 
locally was OK, but that hedging had to be done with Regional Hub. The 
problem with this model is that it describes Helsinki before the bust!

Another possiblity is the agency model, where the local trader acts under the 
direction of the hub trader. This is where Helsinki currently is (although we 
also have an independent manager on site). However, I am not so happy with 
this, and Rick Causey certainly does not like it. Perhaps we should recommend 
independent Risk Managers in every office, but all correspondence and 
settlement with regional hub?

There are a few key people which I believe are essential to achieve our goals

Will Kelly
Kam Keiser
David Baumbach
Darron Giron
Kyle Etter

Also,  Darron Giron will be taking over my role as West controller.  I am 
still considering who should take over my role over the Benchmark and Natural 
Gas P&L.

Lastly,  I am scheduled to take a vacation Thursday and Friday.  I have made 
sure that everyone of the controllers will be here,  and I can be reached by 
pager and phone.  I can cancel this trip if need be.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< BODY >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
Roger.  Mums the word on the gov.

Steven J Kean

sounds good.  I think we should not talk about the conversations with the 
governor . . . I'd rather not prompt them to go to the gov (presumably to 
object to the gov talking to us without talking to them at the same time).

Jeff Dasovich

FYI.  Recently, Chris Calger has asked me to set up a meeting with Sempra.  
ENA's seeking deals with the two big CA gas IOUs (PG&E and SoCalGas) that 
would give ENA access to their assets.  In short, ENA wants to offer a 
complete outsource deal for the IOUs' core gas load (i.e., rez and small 
commercial customers).  ENA would take responsibility for providing service 
for delivery at the city gate and in return would manage all of core's assets 
(upstream of the city gate).  We're meeting with Sempra's "Chief Regulatory 
Office" (Bill Reed) and Sempra's CFO next Thursday to discuss.

Given the fact that Sempra's primarily focused on electricity, the plan is to 
lead off the meeting with a couple of electricity solutions as a bridge to 
the gas offer.  For electricity, the plan has two pieces:  1) a commodity 
offer that beats the 6.5 cent cap (i.e., nothing fancy) and 2) "Deal Bench" 
services with the intent of establishing a procurement mechanism for SDG&E 
that the California PUC could pre-approve (thereby eliminating some of the 
immense regulatory risk SDG&E now faces).

Wanted to run this by folks to gauge reactions.  We'll distribute the slides 
we're putting together as soon as they're drafted--hopefully by COB Friday.

Best,
Jeff

Hi Karen:

Sue did a great job today at the VICA meeting.  I wish I could take Sue and
fellow speaker Fred Pickle up and down the State of California to talk to
business associations about energy.

The audience was very receptive to the presentation.  Now that the energy
crisis has moved off the front page and the legislature is out of session,
people seem better able to absorb the magnitude and long-term ramifications
of long term contracts, the end of direct access, etc.

up and he didn't send anyone in his place.

Carolyn Casavan, VICA co-chair of the energy & environment committee told
Sue to call if there was anything that VICA could do to support efforts to
reinstate direct access to please call.

Hope you have a good weekend.

Talk to you soon

SUBJECT:     RE: Regulatory Updates - General Updates
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< BODY >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
Jeff - I know we are a bit tardy in getting back to you. I think a good place to start would be a close review and routine updates on the following:

1. PGT Gas Accord vs. attempt to convert jurisdiction to FERC in bankruptcy proceeding. As discussed, any delay in PG&E's ability to deal with the generators on a long term basis will facilitate bypass projects into the state.

2. Socal - resurrection of GIR or any plans to open the backbone to firm, path based transportation.

3. Southern Trails battle with Socal to gain access to firm takeaway capacity on SoCal's system and developments in Socal's RLS tariff.

4. Any issues that you believe affect our commercial efforts in California.

Obviously this is a small list. I would appreciate your feedback on issues that you believe to be critical drivers.

Regards,

Stephanie

Stephanie and I met with Jeff Dasovich in San Fransisco on Friday.  Jeff understands that he can play an important/strategic role in assisting ENA West Gas in understanding the regulated issues for Gas... There is no doubt that ENA has spent most of our resources in power ( and for good reason) however we need to re focus energy on gas related structures. 

To facilitate this effort, Jeff has offered to focus some more of his time and effort on coordinating some of the key commercial issues related to California.  Jane and Stephanie need to create a priority list that represents West Gas issues and "Hot Button" or action items. Once created we can work with Jeff on action items.  In addition to this immediate need, Jeff will join our conference call's/meetings ( or attend where possible).  The next session I have on my calendar is Thurs Sept 5 @ 2:30.  

I trust this initiative will further enhance an already effective procedure. If there are any questions, let me know.

regards, 

Barry Tycholiz

This is the David's answer:

The only one that I can think of that may be of use is the "CES Volume
Comparison" report ... that is the one that ya'll had for January that showed
all of the purchases and sales, by pipeline.  It is available for any month.
The reports that I regularly used were for helping to clean up current month
activity, which would not be of any use to you.

David

Hey David,

Could you help me determine the GMS reports that I may need. Thanks for your 
help.

Ami

This is a follow up to the earlier email I forwarded regarding CES historical 
information. Note the deadline of 1/15, I believe that should be Friday 1/14 
so I need your responses by Thursday 1/13. 

Please fill out the spreadsheet for each area and forward back to me. I will 
consolidate our responses from a Logistics perspective. Lets have them add 
everything they need and if challenged we can re-review later.

Thanks - Bob

Last month Richard Burchfield sent us the following list of reports that are 
available from CES's systems.  IT is working on a way to secure an electronic 
copy of the required reports and making them available to us online via the 
electronic document management system.  While ENA is not liable for pre-2000 
business, we may need to assist with research as issues arise.  In order to 
get the ball rolling, we need to get a list together of the reports we need.  
Please fill out the attached spreadsheet and list any reports that you need 
and return it to me by Friday, 1/15/2000.  If you do not want any reports, 
please send me an Email letting me know that.  I have included samples of how 
to fill this out, and if you have any questions please give me a call.

If you aren't sure which reports you need based on the names, please get with 
any CES employees you have hired or with a CES transition employee to get 
clarification.  If you need samples of any of these reports please let my 
assistant, Pam Chambers, know and she will coordinate getting a sample report 
printed for you.  

In addition, I will need a list of the users and their logonid's who will 
need to have access to this data.  Please send that to me by the 15th as 
well.  

Thanks, Bryce

Please see the attached for the Altra GMS report listing.  Please forward any
additional questions relating to Altra GMS to Linda Licarione (713-693-2845)

Attached is a list of 210 reports from Altra GMS.  Please note that we may not
be using all of these reports.  If you need me to scale this down to those
currently being used, I will need to do a bit of analysis.  Many of the base
reports, those denoted in the spreadsheet with filename-location (1st column) 
=
master.mdb are not currently being used at CES.  Let me know if you have any
questions.

Can you provide me with a complete list of GMS reports?

Clay,
I have had several requests from the ENA business groups. now that the
agreement has been finalized, for report lists from your key applications, 
those
being, Altra GMS and Risk Works( there may be others as people become more
aware). There will be a need for information for ENA to manage contracts as we
go through he transition period. We feel this would be an easier process to 
work
through if ENA knows what kind of information they can request as we go 
through
the transition.

Thanks, Richard

SUBJECT:     Re: Tenaska IV 10/00
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< BODY >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
Megan, James, and I met regarding the payment due Tenaska IV.  I am OK with 
paying what is in the system right now.  However, I would like for all of us 
to meet today regarding some accounting issues,  What is everyone's 
availability for this afternoon?

Please let me know ASAP.

In most cases, ENA will be a net buyer from Tenaska IV for activity related 
to the Cleburne plant.  However, for October 2000, the plant was down the 
majority of the month and ENA sold off the supply, resulting in ENA owing 
money to Tenaska IV.

I have created deal 529856 with a demand of $1,798,389.73, which is the 
calculated amount of income on the Cleburne desk. (Please see the attached 
schedule.)   We need to pass this income on to Tenaska IV.  Do we need to pay 
this amount (wire from ENA to Tenaska IV) or is there another way to do 
this?  This is the case for October 2000 and could possibly happen again in 
the future.

Greg, Troy, Jim - Please let me know what you think about settling this.

Megan - Don't pay the amount until we here from the Greg, Troy and Jim.  
Also, make sure that we have received dollars from the spot sales before we 
reimburse Tenaska IV.

D

We have actuals.  The larger of the two volumes is 1,395,000, which is 
45,000/day, so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine.  I am having a 
problem, though, with the way it is coming to settlements.  It is showing up 
with a Jan 2003 delivery date.  I think the demand fee needs to be on 10/1 
only.  Right now, it is on a line with a date of 10/1/00 to 12/31/36.   I 
think this is confusing the system some how.  Also, we still need the 
purchase deal for Tenaska IV.  It should be for a demand fee of $2,571,135.73 
booked to the Cleburne desk.  We actually owe $1,798,389.73, but I need to 
net the Tenaska IV sales with the purchase to clear those receivables.  James 
is calling me every day asking for an update.  Do you know when we will be 
able to get this in the system?  I have attached my spreadsheet so you can 
see the numbers.
