	Subject:		Meeting w/Sempra
	Body:			

FYI.  Recently, Chris Calger has asked me to set up a meeting with Sempra.  
ENA's seeking deals with the two big CA gas IOUs (PG&E and SoCalGas) that 
would give ENA access to their assets.  In short, ENA wants to offer a 
complete outsource deal for the IOUs' core gas load (i.e., rez and small 
commercial customers).  ENA would take responsibility for providing service 
for delivery at the city gate and in return would manage all of core's assets 
(upstream of the city gate).  We're meeting with Sempra's "Chief Regulatory 
Office" (Bill Reed) and Sempra's CFO next Thursday to discuss.

Given the fact that Sempra's primarily focused on electricity, the plan is to 
lead off the meeting with a couple of electricity solutions as a bridge to 
the gas offer.  For electricity, the plan has two pieces:  1) a commodity 
offer that beats the 6.5 cent cap (i.e., nothing fancy) and 2) "Deal Bench" 
services with the intent of establishing a procurement mechanism for SDG&E 
that the California PUC could pre-approve (thereby eliminating some of the 
immense regulatory risk SDG&E now faces).

Wanted to run this by folks to gauge reactions.  We'll distribute the slides 
we're putting together as soon as they're drafted--hopefully by COB Friday.

Best,
Jeff

	Subject:		RE: First Union National Bank ("FUNB")/Enron Corp. ISDA Master
 Agreement
	Body:			

I think permitted transfers are those where the credit support is the same 
(Enron Corp gty covers affiliate we transfer to).  In this case, FUNB could 
transfer to an affiliate if they were willing to gty the obligations of the 
affiliate (since it is the parent, in essence).

Tanya:

For purposes of "Transfer", shall we permit both parties to transfer to 
Affiliates?  Would FUNB require a guaranty?  Or do we feel strongly that 
neither party should have the ability to transfer except with the written 
consent of the other party?

Dear Sally,

Attached is the latest version of the summary.  It is complete, but I'm still 
waiting for Scott E to let me know if anything has been done in Panama.

You mentioned yesterday that you wanted the offices rated.  I have put a 
rating in, based on the number comments, size of the office, and severity of 
the comments, and what I understand the general attitude of the office to be, 
but you should probably take a look at it since you attended some of these 
reviews.

Best regards

Shona

Thank you again.

 Compliance with the Conduct of Business Covenants
	Body:			

With everything going on, I wanted to speak with you about some issues, particularly how things may effect my group.  In light of the attached memo, it does not seem that we can do anything that will cost the company more than $50mm.  What does this mean for what we are looking at?  Can Enron even participate in the Arctic project as a $1mm commitment will, not including the potential additional liabilities, commit the company for more than $50mm.  I guess you can make an argument about it depends upon how you count it.

Anyway, please let me know when you have some time.

Cheers.
