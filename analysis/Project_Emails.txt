When operational capacity changes during any cycle the below comments will need to inserted into the point
or group comment section in CAS. 
1.  Socal Window
2.  Low line pack inventory
3.  I/C or plant non performance
4.  High line pack inventory
5.  Compression status
6.  Other

*During normal business hours except for Evening and ID-2, Myself, Gary, Steve, Terry, or John should be 
responsible for loading comments into CAS unless the Reps. have been given the directive to update comments.
*Weekends, and Holidays, Reps. will be loading comments into CAS.
*When new points or groups show up to be allocated that have not previously been allocated, you will need
to page me or in my absence Gary, Steve.  We will let you know what to do with the capacity either update
or allocate.  
If you have any questions please call me or page.

Thanks DS

When doing allocation process and we allocate points or groups on the Timely, Evening, or Non-Grid. 
We allocate with the capacities that are loaded from CAS.  When allocating points or groups that have
not previously been allocated on any of the previous cycles during ID-1 or ID-2 we need to use the flow rate calculation.
.
Example :  Allocations are as follows

The only point to be exempt from this method should be Socal Needles because of their window issue
Timely:        M/L Thoreau West System                1093.000  (capacity)
I/B Link                                             700.000  (capacity)
Laplata/Ignacio                                  500.000  (capacity)
Socal Needles                                   775.000  (Window)
Evening:      Same sequence 
Non-Grid:     Same sequence

ID-1or ID-2:  Same sequence shows up to be allocated.  
Since they were previously allocated on the earlier cycles we do not need to right mouse 
click and calculate flow and update capacity based on flow rate.  The only time we should 
have to calculate flow rate is when there is a new point or group shows up that has not been previously
allocated.                   

The reason for the change is we have recieved more FERC data requests on capacities and scheduled volumes.
lets try this for a while and see how it is working.

Please note that the Cleburne plant is expected to come back up on Sat. 
morning the 7th of October.  I have already submitted the nominations to 
Lonestar for the weekend (7th-9th), taking all gas to the plant.  If they 
come up early, we have imbalance gas that will serve them.   I have informed 
Mary of this, and will give her a copy of the noms, #'s and contacts, etc....

Thanks,

FYI.

We are finally beginning to put closure on our outage. It has been
frustrating to say the least. We are currently projecting a late Friday or
early Saturday morning startup barring any unseen problems.

CES is buying 2500 dth/day from Equitable in Tenn Z4.  CES is selling 2500 
dth/day to FirstEnergy in Tenn Z4.  Looks like a match to me.  I told Fred 
with Equitable the information John Singer gave to Phil below.  For future 
reference Fred's number is 412-395-3295.  A backup contact at Equitable is 
Steve Rafferty, 412-395-3268.

Per John, FirstEnergy bought the meter (??) from Beldon & Blake effective 
12/1/99.  On CNG, we are showing a purchase (deal 141688) and a sale (deal 
141952) for 2500 dth/day with Beldon & Blake.  I don't see a sale anywhere to 
FirstEnergy.  

Also, I still see an Equitable supply (deal 135956) on CNG for 3226 dth/day.  
I believe this is a duplicate of deal 138741 in Tetco M2.

Comments?

Chris,

This has to do with that TENN zone 4 deal that you e-mailed me about this
morning. Like I mentioned earlier, we never scheduled this gas, it was handled
on a back to back basis.

Phil

Phil,
FirstEnergy called to change the contract number for the sale I made to them
(originally to Belden & Blake) to be delivered to the Carroll Co Meter.  The
new contract number is 32082.
If you receive this email before you page me, that's what the page is about.
Call or email me with any questions.
Thanks,
John

HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

My take is that we will have 4 UBS people and then the ERCOT team and someone from credit.

Jim

I had the same thought last night, as to the QSE agreement, if it is only a month or two until UBS would execute that with ERCOT.  I am hoping that the Enron credit person attending can, if requested, give background on the credit requirements that would be placed on UBS if it became a QSE.  Please let me know the number of attendees when you find out so that we can provide adequate copies for those needing them.  Thanks. -- David 

After thinking about this last night, I would still like to bring to the meeting today at 1pm all the documents that would be necessary for UBS to be "fully" functioning so that we can get this data in front of the UBS legal group.

Jim

I understand from Smith Day that APX forwarded us today a format of contract relating to their potentially serving as QSE for UBS AG trading.  APX is apparently willing to contract on a month-to-month basis (thus allowing us to move to our own IT interface with ERCOT as soon as possible).  

As to item two below, until UBS would have the IT capability (currently under development and projected to be roughly a month from completion) to become certified to act as its own QSE, it would not need to execute any 'market participant' agreement with ERCOT in order to be a power marketer within ERCOT.  As soon as UBS desired to trade Renewable Energy Credits ("RECs"), it would need to sign a standard-form agreement with ERCOT in order to maintain a REC account. 

Trading conducted by UBS with any given counterparty within ERCOT would be pursuant to 'UBSWarburgEnergyOnline' GTCs or else subject to discrete negotiated wholesale power enabling agreements and/or ISDA master agreements. The ERCOT ISO would have no connection with such relationship documents supporting UBS AG trading activities.  On the other hand, as UBS's likely counterparties are entities with wholesale power trading activities of national scope, the timeline for trading in ERCOT is linked to the timeline for completing wholesale power/financial master enabling agreements approved by UBS.  Doug Gilbert-Smith this afternoon identified the following counterparties in decreasing order of of their priority as trading partners in ERCOT:  

TXU Energy Trading 
BP Energy Company
Reliant Energy Services, Inc.
Aquila Power Corporation
Morgan Stanley capitral Group

FPL Energy Power Marketing, Inc.
American Electic Power Service Corporation
Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, LP
Calpine Energy Servicces LP
Dynegy Marketing & Trade
LCRA --Lower Colorado River Authority

along with a couple of incumbent utilities:

San Antonio City Public Service
Reliant HL&P

If you desire Doug Gilbert -Smith to sit in on this meeting, then it would have to be scheduled for Thursday.

UBS Legal and UBS Credit is heading to Houston this Thursday and Friday.  I have asked that ERCOT matters get 1 hour to discuss the necessary contracts that UBS will need to sign to participate in the ERCOT market.

Basically, my understanding is the following --

1.	PUCT Registration Form for Power Marketer
2.	ERCOT ISO Information
QSE [Portz, David]   N/A until IT platform is ready for UBS to serve as its own QSE 
LSE [Portz, David]   N/A 
Wholesale Enabling Agreement [Portz, David]   No ERCOT  involvement 
Other [Portz, David]   REC Trading Account Agreement  
3.	APX Agreement [Portz, David]   initially
4.	Other

Given the list of issues, this assumes that UBSW Energy will not be selling electricity at retail.  If we need this for Day 1, we would have to get an additional license from the PUCT.

Thanks,

Jim

My Dear Thanksgiving Dinner Guests,

you in advance, so don't act surprised.  Since Ms. Stewart won't be coming,
I've made a few small changes:
Our sidewalk will not be lined with homemade, paper bag luminaries.  After a
trial run, it was decided that no matter how cleverly done, rows of  flaming
lunch sacks do not have the desired welcoming effect.  Once inside, our
guests will note that the entry hall is not decorated with the swags of
Indian corn and fall foliage I had planned to make.  Instead, I've gotten
the kids involved in the decorating by having them track in colorful autumn
leaves from the front yard.  The mud was their idea.

The dining table will not be covered with expensive linens, fancy china, or
crystal goblets.  If possible, we will use dishes that match and everyone
will get a fork.  Since this IS Thanksgiving, we will refrain from using the
plastic Peter Rabbit plate and the Santa napkins from last Christmas.

Our centerpiece will not be the tower of fresh fruit and flowers that I
promised.  Instead we will be displaying a hedgehog-like decoration
hand-crafted from the finest construction paper.  The artist assures me it
is a turkey.

We will be dining fashionably late.  The children will entertain you while
you wait.  I'm sure they will be happy to share every choice comment I  have
made regarding Thanksgiving, pilgrims, and the turkey hotline.  Please
remember that most of these comments were made at 5:00 a.m. upon discovering
that the turkey was still hard enough to cut diamonds.
As accompaniment to the children's recital, I will play a recording of
tribal drumming.  If the children should mention that I don't own a
recording of tribal drumming, or that tribal drumming sounds suspiciously
like a frozen turkey in a clothes dryer, ignore them.

They are lying.
We toyed with the idea of ringing a dainty silver bell to announce the start
of our feast.  In the end, we chose to keep our traditional method.

We've also decided against a formal seating arrangement.  When the smoke
alarm sounds, please gather around the table and sit where you like.

In the spirit of harmony, we will ask the children to sit at a separate
table.  In a separate room.  Next door.

Now, I know you have all seen pictures of one person carving a turkey in
front of a crowd of appreciative onlookers.  This will not be happening at
our dinner.  For safety reasons, the turkey will be carved in a private
ceremony.  I stress "private", meaning:  Do not, under any circumstances,
enter the kitchen to laugh at me.  Do not  send small, unsuspecting children
to check on my progress.  I have an electric knife.  The turkey is unarmed.
It stands to reason that I will eventually win.  When I do, we will eat.

I would like to take this opportunity to remind my young diners that
"passing the rolls" is not a football play.  Nor is it a request to bean
your sister in the head with warm tasty bread.  Oh, and one reminder for the
adults:  For the duration of the meal, and especially while in the presence
of young diners, we will refer to the giblet gravy by its  lesser-known
name:  Cheese Sauce.  If a young diner questions you regarding the origins
or type of Cheese Sauce, plead ignorance.

Before I forget, there is one last change.  Instead of offering a choice
between 12 different scrumptious desserts, we will be serving the
traditional pumpkin pie, garnished with whipped cream and small
fingerprints.  You will still have a choice:  take it or leave it.

Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving.  She probably
won't come next year either.    I am thankful.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vince,

Just to let you know, the books will be shipped to both you and Rice  
University tomorrow by express mail, which means the books should arrive 
within  5 days (depending on customs).

Rice has purchased 25 books, and I informed them that if they don't sell  
them all, we will?credit their account?with the amount of unsold  copies.? 
I've asked them to?give you?any extra copies instead of  returning them.

Please find attached the invoice for the 50 books.

Thanks again, and if you need anything further, please let me know.

Julie
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken - 

Good morning.  

As a follow up to the voice mail that I left for you, following are some 
background and preparatory notes for a potential phone call today between 
Chancellor Reed and yourself.  Communications and indications from the UC/CSU 
team are that he may call you today as a follow up to your discussion with 
him on February 2, 2001.  As I mentioned at the Executive Committee meeting 
on Tuesday, 2/20/01, all things are moving along well in California with our 
clients, PG&E and SCE.  The current exception to the "smooth sailing" is 
UC/CSU.  Tom Riley, the account manager for UC/CSU, has prepared the 
following outline of business concerns, sequence of events and suggested 
talking points.

Ken, thank you for your assistance and continued participation with this 
client.

Regards - Dan

******************************************************************************
*********************
Business Concerns

UC and CSU have business concerns regarding Enron's action to De-DASR their 
accounts.  They have not communicated their concerns with enough detail that 
would allow us to address them, but I have been able to surmise that they 
consist of the following:

1.  UC/CSU is now a bundled access customer instead of a direct access 
customer.  AB-1X, recently signed by Gov. Davis, has ban language preventing 
large commercial/industrial customers from going Direct Access.  Per Jeff 
Dasovich of Enron Gov. Affairs, it is not clear, but possible, that if we had 
not De-DASRed the accounts, that UC/CSU might have been grandfathered as a 
direct access customer.  Further, SB-27X (still pending), which is Senator 
Bowen's attempt to reverse the ban language of AB-1X, may have a financial 
ramification for customers switching to and from Direct Access status.  
Dasovich is investigating further.

the contract.  Our action is forcing the utility to remove these 
University-owned meters, meaning that their meters will become useless.  We 
are currently using those meters to provide daily 15 minute interval data as 
required in our contract. (Our operations and billing group have come up with 
a transition plan that SCE has agreed to. SCE would install dual-sockets 
allowing for the installation of the SCE meter, while keeping our meter in 
tact, mitigating their concern.  At this point, UC and CSU are not listening 
to our business solutions so we have not received feedback from them on this 
solution).

3.  We have a contractual obligation to be the Universities scheduling 
coordinator (SC).  As a result of our action, we are no longer their SC.  
They are concerned this may inhibit our ability to act as their SC for their 
recent proposal to the ISO under the Demand Reduction Program.

Sequence of Events

February 1 - I informed the UC/CSU electricity oversight board leaders and 
contract administrators of Enron's decision.  I walked through the power 
point presentation.  They expressed no concerns at that point, and even 
expressed appreciation we were standing by our contract.  I sent the UC and 
CSU contract administrators the letter later that day advising them of our 
decision.

February 2 - Ken Lay called Chancellor Reed assuring the Chancellor that we 
will honor the contract.  I have since heard that this call was extremely 
well received and that the CSU campus VPs have been advised of the call and 
Ken's assurances that were communicated.  We offered the call to the UC 
President as well, but were channeled to his SVP.  By the time I made contact 
with the SVPs administrator, we had begun receiving letters (below), so I 
backed off on arranging the call.

February 5 - UC and CSU contract administrators inform us they have been 
speaking to their regulatory advisor and asked for some clarifications.  
Maureen Palmer and I speak to the contract administrators and answer their 
questions.  

February 8/9 - UC and CSU send letters to their PG&E and SCE account managers 
advising them they have concerns regarding Enron's decision, and that they 
(PG&E and SCE) should only De-DASR on the Universities' request.

February 12 - I received a letter from the UC/CSU contract administers asking 
for clarifications regarding our action, and requesting we re-DASR their 
accounts.

February 14 - I responded with a letter providing them with responses to 
their clarification questions, but did not offer to re-DASR their accounts as 
they had requested.

February 16 - UC informed me they were unhappy we did not comply with their 
request to re-DASR and indicated they would be sending another letter.  I 
suspect this letter will express potential legal recourses.

February 20 - CSU and UC informed they would hold off on the letter pending 
outcome of a call between Chancellor Reed and Ken Lay.

Throughout the entire process, I have been asking that the business 
administrators meet with us so Enron can hear their concerns.  I gather CSU 
would like to do this, however, UC is more inclined to write letters and seek 
legal remedies.

Suggested Talking Points for Call and Desired Outcome

1.  We were faced with a difficult business decision, and made our California 
decision with our customers in mind.  We have kept our contracts in tact.  
Other energy service providers have left the market and their customers.

2.  We are an energy outsourcing company.  We should source supply from the 
"best available" source in the marketplace. We feel we have a contractual 
right to have made the decision.

3.  Desired outcome is that we want to sit down with the University business 
administrators to listen to and address their concerns.  We have not been 
afforded this opportunity to date though we have offered.  However, the 
Chancellor needs to understand we are not willing to re-DASR their accounts 
in the meantime.

I will be available for the debrief with Ken if desired.  I can be reached at 
925-543-3703 (office), or 925-548-0326 (mobile) if you have any questions.

Regards, Tom

Scott Mollner Recomendation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Several thoughts from federal reg./transmission side:
I haven't worked with a VEPCO interconnection agreement yet, but many times 
there are requirements that the generator is required to provide emergency 
power to the interconnected transmission provider, in which case you would 
want the interconnection agreement to cover all costs you would incur to 
replace the energy at a different location (usually it is difficult to get 
this agreement, so you should check and then factor that into the equation).  
I would be happy to look at the interconnection agreement with you.
Interconnection of generation is a separate process from requesting 
transmission.  It appears that VEPCO has to buy the transmission (or use its 
network transmission) when the Delivery Point is the plant.  Enron will have 
to purchase transmission on VEPCO if it is selling to third parties off the 
plant and will have to purchase transmission on other systems if it wants to 
supply at an alternate delivery point.  Please discuss this with Kevin 
Presto's tranmission people (Bill Rust on 31).  Enron cannot use VEPCO's 
network transmission to delivery to third parties.
Is this plant in the VEPCO queue yet?  Also, FERC has issued some recent 
rulings that deal with time limits on system impact studies, etc.  While 
VEPCO is probably incentivized to get this built, you want to make sure that 
you do not lose optionality in selling to third parties from the plant due to 
transmission constraints.  A request for transmission on OASIS is the only 
way to ensure deliverability to third parties.
3.5 (c) Intra-day scheduling--You may have hourly transmission risk for an 
increase.  Unless you buy longer term firm, you will deliver from other 
sources using hourly non-firm, which is the lowest priority of transmission 
and subject to getting cut.  You may want to consider doing this on 
best/reasonable efforts basis.  (Also, even if you purchase 
daily/monthly/yearly firm to serve third parties, if you change the point of 
receipt or point of delivery temporarily, your request is treated as 
non-firm.)
12.4--Currently VEPCO is interested in joining the Alliance ISO (an RTO that 
has not been approved by FERC yet--competing ISO to Midwest ISO), but since 
FERC has not approved any RTO for VEPCO yet, there could be significant 
changes in the transmission charges/methods of obtaining 
transmission/grandfathering of current transmission, etc during this 
contract.  Make sure with the ENA attorneys that this out/increase in price 
covers that circumstance.
Underlying tranmission rates on VEPCO or any other provider can change at 
most any time, subject to the provider filing a rate case.  Therefore, any 
current transmission rates shown on OASIS are not necessarily what you will 
pay over the term of any transmission that Enron may purchase to serve this 
contract.  Generally, transmission providers will not agree to fixed rates.

Tom Chapman

Christi--

This is the note that I received on Tuesday June 13.  This is a relatively 
early draft of the PPA.

I think that we still have to purchase the land associated with the sites and 
do the due diligence on the site with regards to some of the siting issues.  
IN addition, in NC we are going to get a CPCN to site the plant to speed up 
the regulatory process in the NCUC.  I think that this will make the issue 
less contentious because of the NCUC's acceptance of the Dynegy plant at 
Rockingham that had a PPA with Duke Power.  

Using the Dynegy plant as a guideline, their only stumbling block was their 
gas agreeement.  They built a bypass off Transco.  We would be taking gas 
from the LDC of Rocky Mount.  Having talked with the regulatory folks at the 
NCUC who handle gas issues, this is the preferred route.  So, I do not think 
that we have any major state issues.  I think that right now we are simply 
working on some of the siting issues.

That being said, I will let you take a look at the PPA and let me know or 
Jeff Keenan (or even Heather Kroll or Ozzie Pagan) if you think that there 
are some transmission issues or other issues on the federal level.  

Thanks.

Tom

Lisa:  Attached is a draft of the Power Purchase Agreement with VEPCO, based 
on the current version of the term sheet.  In preparing the draft, we did 
encounter several additional questions for Enron's consideration.  These are 
noted with brackets and, in some cases, italicized notes, in the draft and 
are also highlighted below.  You may want to address these issues before this 
goes to VEPCO.

Cover and first page-- Should the party to the agreement (for the moment) be 
ENA or a special purpose company?

Definitions--  We included a defined term "Emergency Start-Up" (a start up or 
increase in energy scheduled during a day) and a place in Exhibit A to 
include a price for this, although this was not covered in the term sheet.

Section 2.2--  We included a provision for VEPCO to take test energy (energy 
charge only; no demand charge)--do you want this?

Section 2.3--  This was taken from the term sheet, but is it correct that COD 
will be July 1 (since the demand charge is supposed to start June 1?)  Also, 
it would be best to define "commencement of construction" to avoid 
controversy down the road.  We could either do this now or put in a 
placeholder that indicates it needs to be defined or be silent, whichever is 
your preference.  Also, bear in mind that we have not included a specific 
remedy (e.g., liquidated damages) if the Seller does not achieve that 
milestone on time.  Under the default provision (Section 8.1(c)), there would 
be a 30 day period to cure before Buyer could terminate (extendible to 90 
days if a longer period of time is needed and Seller diligently pursues the 
cure).  Would you prefer the right to pay ld's and extend the time period?

Section 3.1(b)--  Should the 1400 hour limitation apply to all sales under 
this PPA or only sales from the Facility?  I.e., would you use this Agreement 
to sell to VEPCO power in addition to what would be available from the 
Facility?  Also, is this a calendar year limitation--i.e., could they take 
1400 hours in the period June-Dec. 2001 or does the 1400 hours need to be 
pro-rated for the first year?

Section 3.4-- Since this is not a base load plant, the normal definition of 
Availability as the number of hours in a year of operations compared to the 
total hours in the year would not seem to be applicable.  Instead, we stated 
that the Facility would be capable of being available 92% of the year (other 
than due to Force Majeure and 336 hours (2 weeks) of scheduled 
maintenance)--i.e., that if they tried to schedule it, it is expected to be 
available.  Is that what Enron intended?  Additionally, the term sheet stated 
that a remedy for failure to meet Availability would need to be agreed--why 
wouldn't cost of cover damages be appropriate? Also, please note that we 
included language stating that Seller will not perform maintenance during 
peak periods.

Section 3.5(b)-- Please note the bracketed language re taking Blocks of 
Energy.  We have 50 MW minimum blocks but the capacity is 223--should we 
allow the last Block to be 23 if they've scheduled all the rest?

Section 3.5(c)-- Please see the bracketed language at the end of this Section.

Section 4.7-- Should there a required minimum take of Energy?

Article 6-- The Genco/Santee Cooper form of PPA we used as a model did not 
have any provisions on metering.  (See placeholder note in Article 6.)  Do 
you want to add such a provision, ignore it or just include a placeholder for 
now?

Section 9.1-- Is 30 days from invoice correct for the payment due date or 
would you prefer a shorter period?

Article 15-- The Genco/Santee Cooper form had mediation as a required step 
prior to arbitration.  Should we keep that?  Also, the form of arbitration is 
"baseball" arbitration--i.e.,  the arbitrators have to chose one party's 
position or the other's.  Is that what you want?

Section 16.2--  We used New York for governing law, on the premise that it 
will be difficult to get VEPCO to agree to Texas law and we would not 
recommend Virginia law for this contract.

Exhibit A-- There are a number of questions on the pricing exhibit--please 
see the bracketed notes therein.

Please call and let us know how you would like to proceed on this draft.

Lisa - The attached schedule calculates interest on overdue interest at the 
9.9% rate.  This is fine except that I do not know if we are able to charge 
interest on overdue interest.  That is Richard Sanders call - Richard, please 
let us know.  If we can charge interest on interest, this schedule is fine.  
Otherwise, we will have to recalculate using simple interest.

John-

Attached is the schedule that we had at Monday's meeting which has been 
updated through 10/31/00.   After looking more closely at the schedule and 
the way it is calculating interest, it appears that interest is being 
compounded.  The estimate that we had used in Monday's meeting was simple 
interest for one year calculated on the sum of $1,061,300.90 and $264,452.89 
(October 1999 values) which equated to roughly $131,246.65.  However,  based 
on the schedule's calculation, I believe the total interest and principal due 
is $1,171,585.67.  Please look over this schedule and see if you agree with 
my thinking.

Thank you,
Lisa

(1) I have a message into Mark Seffinger at ING Barings with respect to item 
1.

(2) I left a message with Mark Elliott.  I still have not heard from him.

Jason:  (1)  You were going to verify whether or not arbitration (for the
executing brokers) is mandatory.  Have you heard anything?

(2)  Did you ever speak with Mark Elliott about ITG?  Are you still having
problems connecting with him?

Rick:
Eight new projects--of which some are significant in size-- have been added 
to the list of the hot deals for May 25th, 2001.  They--and their suggested 
action items--are as follows:

Project  Originator  Description     
EBS:
Advertising JV  Erik Simpson  EBS to provide risk management to media 
buyer   ($28 million)
Raven   Jeff Donahue  Purchase assets of managed hosting company ($400 
million)
Samsung DRAM Ken Wang  1 month financing of DRAM Inventory (5 million)

Suggested Action Item:  Communicate findings to Sue Nord and compile GA 
comments for RAC, if any.  Lisa Yoho is also informed given the very 
interesting structure of Samsung DRAM deal that is likely to be repeated with 
other seriously backwardated commodities.  
EWS/EGM
Weirton   Tammy Mulroony  Rolled Steal forward purchase ($ 75 million)
Timber      Sale of 100 MM asset at cost  ($100 million)
DPR accelerated put Mike Beyer  Exercise Put and reinvest in coal related

Suggest Action Item:  Communicate findings to J. Steffes, and Lisa Yoho and 
compile GA comments for RAC, if any.

Finally, I am taking the liberty to contact Paul Kaufman to inform him of 
project PortMorrow which is the developing of 47 MW peaking facility in 
Oregon for PGE (originator Chuck Randall).  I shall follow up with him in 
case that there are any needed action item.  

Of course, please let me know if you have any question.

Good morning, everyone.

Just wanted to let you know that we finally have some of our proofs 
available on-line.  It isn't our whole book, but it is a fair sample.  I 
think they got most of the pictures of you guys posted if you are interested 
in buying a print.  I believe you can order directly from the page.

If anyone wants to see more, call Andrea or myself and we can help you out.

Steps for accessing the proofs are:

1.  Point your browser to "www.elanphotography.com"
2.  From the home page, select "Weddings"
3.  From the Weddings page, select "On-line Ordering".  This will open a new 
browser window to a list of weddings shot by our photographer.
4.  Select the "Childers/Luebbering" wedding.
5.  This will prompt you to enter a username and password.
Enter:
username: childers
password: gnirebbeul
6.  Browse at will.  I believe there are three or four pages of proofs.  If 
you drill down on a picture, you can order it there.

Let me know if you have any problems accessing this site.

Later,

Jason
