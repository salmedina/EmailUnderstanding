DATES: earlier | last | week | April | 30th | 
If you haven't voted already, I urge you to vote now for ANDREW STRONG of
Houston for President-Elect of the Texas Young Lawyers Association (TYLA).
Your ballot should have arrived from the State Bar earlier last week.  Don't
let that ballot just sit in your in-box!! Andrew has devoted himself to
working with children and young-adults in Houston throughout the state. He
sincerely believes in community service, and as our President, I believe
that Andrew will work hard to promote assistance and programs for the less
fortunate.  In addition to his professional accomplishments and his civic
works, ANDREW is truly a good guy.  He is deserving of our support and our
votes.

It is very important that you return your ballot, especially since ANDREW is
running against a Dallas opponent.  In the past TYLA elections, less than
25% of the eligible voters returned their ballots. These statewide races are
usually won by margins of 200 to 300 votes. Please vote for ANDREW STRONG
and encourage your friends to do the same.  No stamp is required!  The
ballots must be received in the State Bar office by April 30th.

Please check out ANDREW's brochure that lists his numerous accomplishments
and awards that is provided with ballot. If you have any questions, please
contact me at your earliest convenience.

Thanks for your support!

Jim
