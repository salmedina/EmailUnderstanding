Must be on drugs.

We saw an even better one the other day.  Someone was trying to sell a 1972 
Calladic Hurse.  It's white with orange flames on the front fenders!!!  And 
it has a huge stereo system in the back.  Now what kind of freak owns 
something like that and why would you announce it at work?

While waiting for the computer guy to fix my software connections I went 
browsing on the "For Sale" bulletin board.  Some lady is selling a Ball 
Python.  The high points of the snake included the comment that it has "never 
bitten" anyone and that it come with an exercise stick.   If you were a 
snake, would you bite someone with an exercise stick?  Sounds like a time 
bomb to me.The stupid snake also comes with a bed and a light!  Is that so it 
can read in bed?  Who cares about a stupid snake.  The things people try to 
sell.  FYI.  B
