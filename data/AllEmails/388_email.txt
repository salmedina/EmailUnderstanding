Good Morning Aunt Mae -

I got your email.  It was a wonderful surprise to see.  Now about the
shrimp, all you have to do is this....

Since we were only able to send a few shrimp, all you need to do is
mix

1 cup of buttermilk & 1 egg (this is the batter)

Then take 1 cup of flour and season to taste  with cayenne pepper,
black
pepper & garlic salt.  If you aren't comfortable with your seasoned
flour mixture just season the shrimp a little before dipping them into

be
a nice golden brown (ugh, make my mouth water)  :)  

We had such a good time; you just have to come next time.  Kevin said
when he comes in Nov. (hopefully I will be able to come too) he is
going
to bring some shrimp with him.  Just giving you something to look
forward to.  Anyway I be emailing you.  Love ya.

Dana
