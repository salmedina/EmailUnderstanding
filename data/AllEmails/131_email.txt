ANR Cuts HIOS Volumes; Mainline Work Planned

ANR Pipeline says volumes from the High Island Offshore System and West
Cameron near shore blocks have been reduced by 40 MMcf per day due to
compression outages at Grand Chenier. The reduction began Wednesday and will
remain in place until further notice. ANR is also planning to perform
pipeline maintenance on its Southeast Mainline beginning June 4th and
continuing through July 6th. The work will reduce capacity by 195 MMcf per
day from June 4th  10th, 225 MMcf per day June 11th  12th, and by 60 MMcf
per day June 13th  24th. June 25th  26th, capacity will be reduced by 140
MMcf per day and by 220 MMcf  per day from June 27th to July 3rd. The work
will cut capacity by 25 MMcf per day from July 4th  6th. ANR's system
consists of 10,600 miles of pipeline and 74 compressor stations with a
design peak capacity of about 6.6 Bcf per day.
