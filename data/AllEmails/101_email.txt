DATES: July | June | 
Janet,
Please review the attached amendment to see if it sets forth your 
understanding of the pricing to be applicable with regard to the first 
volumes to be delivered during the July - June time period.  I assume you 
want the prices to revert to Index after this period.  Please advise, If 
okay, please forward to Pat Anderson.

Janet H Wallis
