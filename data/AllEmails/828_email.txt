DATES: summer | 
ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT: NOT DISCOVERABLE

EPMI filed an amended petition with the court in Tennessee where EPMI's 
current declaratory judgment action (interface issue) is pending alleging 
that TVA violated NERC rules as a result of TVA's actions during the summer 
of 99.  In order to amend the current petition to include this additional 
claim, EPMI needs the courts approval. 

Please call me if you have any questions.
