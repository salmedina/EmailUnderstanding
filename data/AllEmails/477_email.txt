DATES: summer | 
IMPORTANT!

A little bird told me that 3 out of the 4 candidates Enron has extended 
offers to for the summer are wavering.  The competition is between Enron and 
either consulting or investment companies. 

Please take 10 -15 minutes to contact each candidate (via phone or email) so 
they will have the opportunity to get acquainted with other Enron employees.  
Candidate cultivation is very important in helping a candidate decide between 
two different firms. 

If you do not feel comfortable answering any of the candidates questions feel 
free to direct them my way.

Candidate Name  Contact #  Email Address
