Just wanted to share this.  You may have seen it on the news last night.  My
friend Amy's daughter Hannah was killed Saturday night and the driver that
caused the accident didn't bother to stop.  Not that any of you drive a gold
Monte Carlo, but you never know...Please add Amy, her husband Devin, son
Austin and there beloved Hannah to your prayers.
