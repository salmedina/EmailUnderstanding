DATES: Friday | Friday | Friday | weekend | 
Sounds like a good plan.  I can't wait to hear how it went in Danbury.  
Sounds like the CRRA meeting went well.

I expect that a number of business issues will be discussed tomorrow.  
Whether its tomorrow or Friday, I think to maintain schedule that we will 
need to get the draft P.O. (with the legal revisions) to FCE by Friday.  At 
this point, I am mainly concerned about the business points and the status of 
the technical information.  If we are going to be substantially done by a 
week from Friday, we need to move that portion along faster.  If we get 
feedback on the business points by early tomorrow, I would like to get those 
comments into the draft P.O.  If not, then I want to send the P.O. (with the 
changes we have) to FCE so they can review it on the weekend.
