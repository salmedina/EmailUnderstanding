DATES: June | May | 
Our Board of Directors have tasked SVMG with bringing more energy generation
projects to their attention in June.  In order to accomplish this, we must
gain Working Council input and support in May.  Two projects just emerged in
the past few days that are responsive to SV energy needs and for which
information is available.  With so little time to put together an analysis
and policy package  for the Working Council on the Russell City (Hayward)
and Gilroy peaker projects, I am attempting to put together a team of
energy, land use and environmental members to meet at Calpine this afternoon
at 4 pm to seek consensus on our criteria.  I am seeking at least one
representative from each segment.  Can you attend?  Please let me know ASAP.

Thanks for your help.
