Association May 8th

Here's a follow-up to my earlier e-mail:

Ms. Antoinette Malveaux, President and CEO of the National Black MBA 
Association (NBMBAA) will be at Enron on Tuesday, May 8th to visit with you 
regarding strategic partnerships between our organizations.  Enron has a 
long-standing relationship with the NBMBAA primarily through the National 
Conference and Career Fair which is the largest and most prestigious resource 
for recruiting top minority MBA talent in the country (We have 10 hires from 
last year's convention).  In order for our discussion to have the necessary 
scope and to convey Enron's respect for the NBMBAA organization, Antoinette 
Malveaux will be meeting with top managers from human resources, branding and 
strategic marketing, business development and diversity.  

Here is her bio, as well as some a profile of NBMBAA:
