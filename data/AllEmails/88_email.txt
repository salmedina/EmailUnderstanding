Is EES asking for too much here (especially extending the rate freeze)? =20
Wouldn't it be better to get this thing resolved (assuming that's possible)=
?

Jim.  I like your suggestions and suggest the following enhancements:
We should integrate this solution into the CPUC process. ie Keep rate freez=
e=20
in effect until the Mar 02.  Make state agency take over as ESP to all=20
bundled customers at 110% of frozen rate.  This solution keeps the current=
=20
Rate Freeze in place and keeps us in the game to not lose our negative ctc.=
=20
It also corresponds to your minimal changes goal.  It also puts government=
=20
agency in the same place as us in having exposure to negative ctc as us.  I=
t=20
also accomodates the problem of RFP's taking longer than expected.  It also=
=20

forbearance.  And furthermore it keeps the utility exposed to bankruptcy=20
which minimizes their negotiating power.
I don't understand how this proposal addreses what happens with the existin=
g=20
assets of PG&E.  The worry I have is that PG&E gets to keep 50% of the=20
benefits of nuclear sales and 10% of the benefits of hydro sales, post rate=
=20
freeze.  If we damage 1890, the utilities are now in the drivers seat.
re "ESPs should be able to buy from UDCs at the current weighted average=20
generation rate from 1/1/01 =01) 12/31/02 to serve any competitive load in=
=20
California"  This suggest a replacement to AB 1890 which suggests significa=
nt=20
changes.  Would it not be better to say "After the rate freeze, the=20
government entity would take over the obligations of PG&E and continue them=
=20
to the end of 2002.  Such assumption and continuation, would be combined wi=

Summary of Solution that incorporates these suggestions
Government entity becomes an ESP taking over all customers not served by=20
another ESP.
Government accepts any ESP's that come back within 3 weeks.
Utilities stopped from selling any additional nuclear, hydro, thermal or QF=

Utilities provide surcharge/credit, for the lessor of 40 years or retiremen=
t,=20
based on the difference between generation COS and market value to all ESPs=
,=20
after rate freeze ends (requires change in legislation and settlement).
Government entity, as ESP,  charges Frozen Rate plus 10% until the end of=
=20
2002.
Government entity, assures all ESP that they will their costs will not exce=
ed=20
110% of frozen rate until the end of 2002.
Rate freeze and surcharge continue until the end of March 2002.
Any shortfall of agency would be recovered through a amortization over the=

Government commit to building 10,000 MW of generation by summer of 2002

Attached please find three documents that outlines the economics of LT=20
contracting necessary for PG&E and SCE.  Also find some thoughts on element=

of a workable settlement.

Call me with any questions.

Great idea.  My strategy was solve the immediate problem of solvency quickl=
y=20
by getting the government to step in while the rules of the RFP are defined=
,=20
then do the auction, but if you think we could go straight to an RFP for=20
standard offer without going bankrupt, I would be for it.

I believe that we do not have time for an RFP (6 months) so that we should=
=20
get the government entity to step in to give us the time.

And auction by rate class would be good but noone would want the large=20
classes because their rate increase will be higher and they will be less=20
likely to stay.

Scott




What about something different?

If we asked for an Auction by rate class that would allow a different compa=
ny=20
to market the default service.  The competitive bids would be used to reduc=
e=20
the overall undercollection.  So in your ST point #1, replace Government=20
entity with a Competitive ESP that has paid the most to win that right.
