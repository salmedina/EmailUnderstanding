DATES: Friday | 
Michael,

Attached please find a revised Amendment No. 1 to the Securities Purchase 
Agreement reflecting the new business terms.  This revised amendment should 
supercede the version I distributed on Friday.  In order to expedite the 
review process, I am simultaneously sending a copy of this document to ENA 
for their final approval; therefore, it remains subject to further changes if 
necessary.

Best regards.
