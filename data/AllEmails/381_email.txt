help. If she'll let me, that is.... I agree that tidying up is in order.
It's starting to look overgrown and unused, so I'll do anything I can to
help. Let me break the news to Cameron and I'll get back to you...

The place (outside) is a mess and needs some clean-up (e.g., get all that
old wood out of the front yard, whack down the weeds).  Possible for you
guys to come up next Wednesday night and we can do a quick clean up on
Thursday.  I'm going to try to hire a hauling company to help us and haul
it away.  If Cameron has to work are you available?

Best,
Jeff
