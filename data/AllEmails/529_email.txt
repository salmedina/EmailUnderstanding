DATES: May | 18 | 
Attached is a follow-up memorandum from Adam Wenner summarizing the remaining 
protests in the PGE/Sierra merger proceeding.  We had a good discussion today 
with Sierra's attorney and Peter Fox-Penner (Sierra's market power witness 
who submitted the Appendix A analysis) about our strategy for answering the 
protests (due May 18).   I'll keep you posted on our progress.

In the meantime, please call me if you have any questions or comments.

Attached is a summary of comments on the merger (not including SMUD/TANC,
