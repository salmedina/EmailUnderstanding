DATES: Sunday | 
Wanna go?  Sounds like fun to me.  Michael will love it.

We will have a great game this Sunday at 4:30 PM (the finals of the Texas
Open).  Please come as our guests (Neil and the young ones).

By the way, I picked up a Paper City just to read about you.  I feel like I
know someone famous.  Actually, going to a polo match sounds like a lot of
fun.

Bart just asked for your phone number, which I gave him, of course.  Maybe
the Houston office can pick up the rest of the power work on the project,
should it go forward.
