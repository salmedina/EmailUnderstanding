I would like to review over the weekend and have our goal be to get comments 
out to the business people Tuesday. This is probably much more realistic in 
light of everyone's schedule this weekend.  OK with you?

Attached you will find the latest draft of the new Master Form.  Please 
review and send me any comments today--we'd like to get this out to the 
business team by 3:00 today.  I think all of the comments we received and 
developed in the last 3 meetings have been incorporated, including the 
bankruptcy matters.  Because there are so many changes, I don't think a 
blackline would be helpful--however, let me know if you want one.   I have 
bracketed questions and open issues and highlighted areas that I think need 
either more work or extra attention from the business teams.  I'd like to see 
us be able to pare this document down just a bit--I think a 5 page master and 
a 1 to 1 1/2 page confirmation is reasonable.  Thanks.   MDS
