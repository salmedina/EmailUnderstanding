Wednesday's trading -

Thursday & Friday's trading - 

Officializations - This holiday marks a change to prior procedures due to an increased need for more complete info in RMS.  Ramesh (RAC IT) is going to run a job to copy Wednesday's numbers for Thursday and Friday for all groups for which he has not received books.  I had spoken to a few of you about performing this copy/roll manually.  This is now not required.

This memo should not affect EEL or IR/FX trading.

Please call if you have questions.
