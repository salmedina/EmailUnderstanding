I think it looks good.  a few suggestions though:

I haven't read the whole reprt so I can't say for sure that it alleges no 
price gouging (make sure to forward this to Jeff ... my e-mail is slow on the 
road).  We can say though, that instead of blaming generators and marketers 
the report blames the structure of the market for California's woes.

I think we should shorten the quote to something like " the reprt is 
consistent with what we have said all along.

We should say that the scheduling penalties part of the order will "penalize 
utilities for underscheduling" not predicting.

Hedging is not about holding pirces down so much as it is about protecting 
people from wild price swings ... that's what allowing utilities to buy 
outside the spot should help do.
