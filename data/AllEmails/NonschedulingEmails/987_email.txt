I just wanted to make all of you aware of the message below from Financial 
Operations.  When you review your RC reports for May, you will not see any IT 
charges.  There were also none recorded in April.  Therefore, be prepared to 
see some large charges in June for 3 months (April - June).  If  you have any 
questions, please call me.  Thanks.

Corporate IT has informed me that EIS invoices for April and May have not 
been posted to MSAS.  They are in the  process of trying to correct the 
problem.  However,  you will not see your charges in MSAS this month per 
Corporate IT.  ENA Consolidations is in contact with Corporate IT to ensure 
that the problem will be corrected by the close of June business.

Thanks,

Keith Simper
