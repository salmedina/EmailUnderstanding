DATES: 2001 | 2014 | 
Hi, John,

I have another request for you: Heather and Chu Chu Wang (another Associate 
in my group) are working on the Oyster Creek deal.  Because Chu Chu in on 
vacation now, I just took over his job to continue with the deal.  Heather 
wants me to find out the updated Houston Ship Channel gas curve from 2001 to 
2014.  We only need annual numbers.  

Thanks a lot!
