Sounds good and you missed one hell of a weekend.  From what I hear,
everyone had an awesome time.  Celeste and I counted 12 weddings we got
invited to this year between the two of us and also sometime this
summer,
Celeste and I are going to California to visit Alex and Kelly.  I'll let
everyone know about the invite, but it may be easier for you to let me
know
next time you come in town.

Send me your phone numbers again when you get a chance -
Val

"Trahan, Don"

Florval,
How's married life?  I wanted to congratulate you and Celeste.  Again,
sorry
we were not able to make it down for the wedding.  I think it is safe to
assume that the wedding was a bit more fun than the First Communion we
went
to that Saturday.  I hope there are some good stories.  I am guessing
you
are back from the honeymoon at this point, and you guys had a great
time.
Hopefully, you will hold off on populating the earth with any more
Florval's.  At least give everyone a few more years to begin
preparations.
I hope we can somehow try to get together in the near future.  I may try
to
get down there sometime late summer or fall.  Also, there is always an
open
invitation at the Casa De Trahan here in DC (actually Northern VA - And
to
think in my 1st 18 years, all I thought existed was the Westbank.  There
is
so much more!  Thought you might get a kick out of that comment).  This
invitation is good if anyone is passing through or would like to visit
our
nation's capitol (It's such a better place now that the 'White Trash'
that
was living in the 'White House' has moved out).  I know it not as cool
as
Melancon living 5 blocks from Wrigley, but you know?  The invite holds
good
not only for Mr.& Mrs Louis Florval Generes (what the hell is that?),
but
also any of the other bums down in Houston that I have not seen if a few
years.  Later Val.

Donnie
