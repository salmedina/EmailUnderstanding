Agreement.  The blacklined copy is marked to show changes from the draft
thereof dated 11/3/00.

The Lenders did not have the prior opportunity to review the attached and,
therefore, it remains subject to their comments.

In light of the Thanksgiving holiday next week, the Lenders would prefer to
discuss the attached during the week of November 27.
