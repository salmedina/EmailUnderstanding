Bill -- My understanding was that Enron had satisfied PJM's credit requirements last week; however, below is a notice that the bill has not been paid and Enron will not be able to participate in PJM markets if the bill is not paid by 11/27 COB.

Please let us know if Gov't Affairs needs to call PJM to try to discuss this.  Christi 37007.

FYI 

PAYMENT TO PJM IS OVERDUE 

This is your formal notice that PJM now considers your company in breach of 
the PJM Operating Agreement for non-payment of your November 7, 2001 PJM 
invoice by 1 p.m. today. In accordance with the current provisions of Section 
15.1.3 of PJM's Operating Agreement, you have three business days to rectify 
this breach by making full payment to PJM. If this breach is not rectified by 
the end of PJM's business day on Tuesday, November 27, 2001, PJM will declare 
your company in default and terminate your rights to participate at PJM 
committee meetings, to transact business in PJM's markets, and to receive 
transmission service from PJM. Additionally, all PJM Members will receive a 
list tomorrow of companies that did not pay their invoice for October activity 
on the due date.
