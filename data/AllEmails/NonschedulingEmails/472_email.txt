DATES: 1085 | spring | summer | 
Apologies.  The competitive default provider bill is actually being sponsored 
by our brave compatriots at The New Power Company.
Best,
Jeff

core/noncore split in electricity

AB 1085 is AES' competitive default provider bill.  It's not an emergency 
bill, so it will be dealt with throughout the remainder of the spring and 
summer.
AB 57 is a legislator's suggestions on how long-term contracts should be 
"regulated."  Also no an emergency bill.
AB18X is an emergency bill and it would create a core/noncore split in 
electricity similar to the one that exists in California's gas market.

Best,
Jeff
