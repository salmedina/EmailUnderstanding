Dear Market Participants

On October 17, 2001, the NYISO web servers will be upgraded.  This will
require both software and hardware changes.  While these changes will be
transparent to the users, these changes will require that the MIS system

HAM transactions or modifying Day Ahead bids should act accordingly.

The NYISO will minimize the duration of the outage as much as possible

these changes will result in a more stable environment and provide enhanced
services that the current web servers are unable to perform.

If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
Representative or the Help Desk at (518) 356-6060.

Thank You
Customer Relations
