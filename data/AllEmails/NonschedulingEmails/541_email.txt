DATES: April | 24 | 
So far so good.  Lets see if we can get through the day...

I have already incorporated Lee's comment in a new Version 7.  I am just
waiting for any additional comments.

now, and it need to be.  By this e mail, Tom and Peter, please
incorporate those comments.

Engeldorf, Roseann; Bills, Lisa

I sent this email from GE to Dale/Bill after I received it.  Since
Peter's last draft was April 24, I'm I assume this wasn't included:

Kay/Bill,

Bill says he agrees and accepts our comments to the A&A.

One change required to the Rev 5 document.  In Exhibit B, Add item
"27)One
additional Human Machine Interface (HMI) per Unit (desktop PC type)"

Include these changes and we can get this done tomorrow.

Thanks,

Lee
