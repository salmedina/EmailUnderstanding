Dear Andy,

Let me thank you for your time last Monday.

I never realized that the phone conversation lasted for about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Indeed, it was a reconfirmation of what I have read and understood to be the Gas and Power Business. More than anything else, I have learned a lot from that conversation. I appreciate your thoughts on trading natural gas in particular, and your experiences at Enron, in general. 

To bigger volumes and larger revenues!

Sincerely,
Yvan
