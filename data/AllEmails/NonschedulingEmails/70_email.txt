DATES: Friday | 
As the weather was surprisingly warm yesterday compared to the forecast, we are currently experiencing record injections and are attempting to cut back some of the over-injections that we've accepted during the last few days.  Therefore we are accepting no additional over-injections other than downhole transfers.

Niagara/Pendleton to Ellisburg &/or Leidy  remains wide open for transportation through the system.  (100,000+ through Concord).

I'll be leaving for Canada for a little fishing on Friday.  In my absence, Debbie Kupczuk will be accepting Daily Capacity Desk calls @ 716-857-7602.

or you could leave a message.
