I visited with John Higgins, Bridgeline's attorney and discussed the wareho=
useman's lien.  I pointed out the Section 542 of the bankruptcy code requir=
es them to turn over property of the estate and our position is they don't =
have a valid lien.  I also indicated they were opening themselves up to dam=
ages for violation of the bankrupcty stay.  John indicated that since this =
issue (whether Article 7 of the UCC applies to natural gas storage)  would =
be a case of first impression they would be willing to litigate considering=
the amounts involved.  Summary - They are not willing to release the gas. =
They are willing to release gas in excess of the amounts we owe to them, b=
ut only if stipulated that they are not waving their rights to assert the w=
arehouseman's lien .  At this point it is probably better to get some gas a=
nd then decide whether to litigate the remainder.  Thoughts?  [Zisman, Stua=
rt]  This sounds like the right way to go.  Joe Parks should visit with the=
appropriate person at Bridgeline to figure out how much gas they are willi=
ng to release and try to get it sold.  Stuart,  the answers to your questio=
ns are inserted below.



I think we need to crystallize, in very short order, what the approval proc=
ess  [Zisman, Stuart]  Gerald when you are able to figure out what must be =
done please advise. will be for the sale of the Pad Gas in Storage Caverns =


Several interesting points from the meeting:

1)  Bridgeline is of the view that 3/12/2002 (we thought it was 4/402) is t=
he last day on which they are obligated to reimburse Enron for the Dow Leas=
e - Any thoughts?  Who is right?; The contract states that they are obligat=
ed to reimburse through the earlier of July 1, 2002 or 114 days following t=
he 4 BCF Date.  The 4 BCF date is defined at the day of the last Enron Pad =
Gas Payment.  The last Pad Gas Payment (for the month of November) was due =
on 12/10/01.  Thus, the 114 days should run from 12/10/01, which puts right=
around 4/4/02.  [Zisman, Stuart]   The Bridgeline folks said something abo=
ut an August date and then adding 110 days to that and then adding 114 days=
to that.  Does that make any sense to you?=20

2)  Their plan (assuming our deal goes through) is to amend and assume the =
existing lease - and get Dow to expressly release LRCI from any and all cla=
ims/liabilities/etc. following Bridgeline's assumption of the amended lease=
; This approach sounds reasonable.=20


k is owed by Enron for dewatering brine removal fees ($0.20 per ton of salt=
removed) - I need your help to determine whether this is accurate; I don't=
see any basis for this in the agreement.  The $0.20 per ton of salt remove=
d fee, refers to barrels of capacity being created in the Cavern #1.  This =
is related to the leaching operation.  If the fee is related to the leachin=
g operation, then they might be correct. (Accounting would need to verify t=
heir numbers though).  If they are seeking a fee for brine removal during d=
egassing, I don't think they have a basis for this fee.  We need to underst=
and their basis for the claim.   [Zisman, Stuart]  Brian would you please c=
all Gary to find out what this is all about?=20

4)  Bridgeline is desirous of having Cavern #1 (along with the various righ=
ts-of-way) conveyed sooner rather than later (and wondered whether we could=
expedite the approval process on this part of the deal).  I don't know wha=
t the advantages/disadvantages there are to this but would love your input =
along with your thoughts on whether this is feasible or not; We have until =
July 1, 2002 to convey the Cavern #1.  To the extent we wanted to wait to w=
rap up all our issues and convey at that time, we are not harmed under the =
Partnership agreement.  Obviously we retain any risks associated with owner=
ship of the cavern.  [Zisman, Stuart]    Is there any downside to doing it =
early?  Might we lose negotiating leverage?  If not, we should consider try=
ing to do this as a good faith gesture.=20

5)  We indicated that we thought the approval process would take approximat=
ely 30 days from the day that we reached what we believed were mutually agr=
eeable terms with Bridgeline (does this sound right?) - The goal is to be d=
one no later than March 1, 2002; and I think this sounds reasonable.=20

6)  Eric Booth is going to call Robert Morgan to get the support for the $5=
50k of expenses relating to the dewatering line and the flowline.
