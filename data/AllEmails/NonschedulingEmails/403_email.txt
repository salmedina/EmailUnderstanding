DATES: last | Wednesday | Christmas | 
Hi Mark, 

I'm still waiting to hear back from the President of Western Union. I met 
with the company psychologist last Wednesday and she said that she thought I 
would be offered a position within a few days. The long wait game wears on 
you after a while. 

We were talking about coming up to Breckinridge to ski with you one day, 
perhaps Christmas. What day do you arrive and when do you leave.  

Have a great day. 

Larry
