DATES: 1997 | 
I have sent a reminder.  The EES team has been working around the clock on 
California matters, so I'm not surprised that they haven't focusses o this yet

Steve - I am concerned that just through inertia, we are not getting rapid 
closure on Mike Dahlke's move to a new role.  There is no doubt in my mind 
that he can do good service in EES, and he has met with several people 
there.  Mike is concerned that he might get stuck, as he apparently was in 
1997, in limbo for a long time, which he found very professionally and 
personally frustrating and stressful.  Can you help, especially in your HR 
capacity?   thanks  mcs
