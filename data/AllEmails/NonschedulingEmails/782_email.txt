That is an all time winner right there...I think I'll use that at work today!

Regardless of your position on using or having guns, this is one of the
best comeback lines of all time. It is a portion of a  National Public
Radio (NPR) interview between a female broadcaster and US  Marine Corps
General Reinwald who was about to sponsor a Boy Scout Troop  visiting his
military installation.

FEMALE INTERVIEWER: So, General Reinwald, what things are you going to
teach  these young boys when they visit your base?

GENERAL REINWALD: We're going to teach them climbing, canoeing, archery,
and  shooting.

FEMALE INTERVIEWER: Shooting! That's a bit irresponsible, isn't it?

GENERAL REINWALD: I don't see why, they'll be properly supervised on the
rifle range.

FEMALE INTERVIEWER: Don't you admit that this is a terribly dangerous
activity to be teaching children?

GENERAL REINWALD: I don't see how. We will be teaching them proper rifle
discipline before they even touch a firearm.

FEMALE INTERVIEWER: But you're equipping them to become violent killers.

GENERAL REINWALD: Well, you're equipped to be a prostitute, but you're
not  one, are you?

The radio went silent and the interview ended.
