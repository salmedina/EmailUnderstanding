DATES: January | 3rd | 
Congratulations on the new house, a job you love, and the baby on the way.
Do you remember Chou? (my dog)  You're never going to believe this...but she
turns 18 on January 3rd.  I think she found the fountain of youth somewhere
and never told me about it. but told the other animals...the rabbit's 8 1/2,
2 of my birds are pushing 9yrs, etc.  (little lovebirds...I think 9 yrs is
really unexpected for them...guess the birds aren't aware of that. :) )

If you hadn't told me what Enron does, I wouldn't have ever known.  I've
never heard of them.  Are they local to Houston?

Very cool that you and Patrick (Pat?) were set up on a blind date...proof
that those work sometimes!  Well, believe it or not, I still have a little
bit of Xmas shopping to do, so I better go.  Talk to you soon.
