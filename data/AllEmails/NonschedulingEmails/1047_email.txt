The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new=

er garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the=
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The =
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is cu=
rrently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly empl=
oyee cost of $94.00.

to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be m=
ade as spaces become available.=20

The  Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be open=
ed until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level=
entrance to Enron Center North until  Sky Ring access is available. Garage=
stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exi=
t in the event of elevator trouble.=20

rking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your em=
ail, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and=
receive a parking transponder along with a an information packet for the n=
ew garage.
