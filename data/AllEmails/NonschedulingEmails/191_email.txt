DATES: November | 8 | 
please follow up on this potential deal.

Doug Leach called me about this.  Could one of your guys call this guy and 
see if there is anything we can do to help him.  He is a friend of Doug's and 
will give us the business if we are competitive.  Supposedly he has a very 
favorable fixed price offter from a competitor, so I think it is a fishing 
expedition.

Thanks,

Tom

Tom,

I will be out of town until November 8 so if Enron is interested in quoting 
LSU a ten year physical natural gas price, then please contact Mr. Joe Kelley

Doug
