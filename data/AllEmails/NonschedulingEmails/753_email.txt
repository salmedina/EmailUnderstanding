DATES: this | week | 
Following please find the Daily EnronOnline Executive Summary.

Due to size constraints on the Outlook System, the Public Report can no longer be included in the same email with the Weekly Management report. The Public Report is still accessible, however, at the intranet site address listed below. For this week, we will also be sending a supplemental email with the Public Report attached. 
The Weekly Management and Public reports can now be accessed directly through the EnronOnline Intranet Site at WEBLINK

In order to access these report,  click on the link above. Once there, follow the link entitled "Reports" and then select the "Secured Reports" tab. A dropdown menu will appear with a list of the various secured reports available for viewing. After choosing the report you are interested in, a security window will appear requiring you to enter your Windows login ID and password. Simply enter your standard login and the report will load automatically.

We look forward to your feedback and comments. If you have any questions or experience any difficulties accessing your reports through the Intranet Site, please feel free to contact either Bryan Deluca at x36161 or Simone La Rose at x31670.
