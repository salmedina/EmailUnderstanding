work better for me.

Stinson,

Great! I'm looking forward to a very productive collaboration.

on the Enron/Stanford program.

Many Thanks to you and Vince, and I hope to see you soon at Stanford
or Enron. If I remember correctly, Vince is visiting Stanford in
October.

Best Regards,

Nick,

I spoke with Paul Racicot, head of trading for  EBS, North America this
morning.   He said that he is happy to send the $100,000 for your program
from his budget.   I have forwarded to him the draft letter to accompany
the funds and will try to follow up to make sure that the money is sent
promptly.
