These matters are scheduled to be addressed at the August 1
Board meeting. Attached is a memo that outlines ISO Management's preliminary
thoughts and recommendations on how to structure the process for conducting
and the parameters of the Valley-Rainbow RFP.  Please provide us your
thoughts and feedback on these matters no later COB Friday, July 21.  Please

recommendations outlined below are clearly a work-in-progress, it is
imperative that we receive your substantive feedback early so that we can
develop a fair and reasonable final recommendation. Thanks for your time and
