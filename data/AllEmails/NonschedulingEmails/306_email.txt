DATES: summer | winter | this | week | June | 
Thanks for the note....remember that on NNG, Gray is an exempt point (fuel to the Permian Mids 1-7 is only 1.06 %, and the commodity is only about a penny more than from Halley).  This should have pretty good value for the summer (value similar to your West Texas lateral).  In the winter, the rate to demarc is 2.66% + 1.5 cent commodity on NNG if you want some pricing points.

Thanks, Kim.   

fyi.  I had requested Earl to provide an update on this interconnect.  If we have actual flows scheduled (and we know we have 25,000 of firm contracted) before the 12/1 date, we might have to do something at Halley to balance flows.  Should we start working out the details of that?

R-O-W has gave 30 day notice to adjacent landowners
Survey has been completed for pipeline
SHPO & F&F survey being completed on pipeline route
Valves has been quoted for a 8 -12 week delivery, unacceptable. Have requested buyer purchase Grove Valves with a 4 week delivery.
Should know on pipe this week for delivery and cost.
The existing Gray county I/C will be relocated to P-3 as a complete unit
An 8" meter tube and two 12" valves have been located from surplus for installing at the original I/C with dry flow measurement
Installation will be T&M to reduce time frame for bid package and drawings and allow quicker contractor move in and start up.

The target date is 11-1-01, but with the delay, 2 1/2 months, in approving the P.A., as stated in the original cost estimates, E&C required a June approval to meet the in service date of 11-1-01, we have a forecast ready for service date of 12-01-01. We will expedite materials and installation in an attempt to meet the target date.
If any questions, lease let me know
