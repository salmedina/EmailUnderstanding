give her the contributions.  She was speechless as were the rest of her 
family members there.  She said it gave her a lot of strength to know that so

I was talking to Tana today and Tana made a great suggestion that we get 
together a small group to take her to lunch one day a few weeks before she

lots of people.  So I think she might like meeting in a small group of folks 
from work so that when she comes back its not the first time she sees 
everyone.
