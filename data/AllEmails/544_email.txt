DATES: Friday | 3300 | 
I am attaching marked and clean copies of the following documents:

1. Letter Agreement between Enron North America Corp. and NorthWestern
Generation I, LLC;
2. ENA Promissory Note (Exhibit A);
3. First Amended and Restated LLC Agreement (Exhibit C);
4. Escrow Agreement (Exhibit F); and
5. ENA Guaranty (Exhibit G).

Per my discussions with Jerry, Marguerite Kahn will circulate electronic
drafts of the transaction documents on Friday (once she has finished editing
them).

Best regards,
